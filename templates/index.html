                <p>For the past 7 years, I lived close to one of my friends. We both moved 2000 miles from the same city to the same city (18 months apart), and for a long time, he was my only friend in the new place. We’ve watched every major football match together (except the 2022 World Cup final, sigh). We’ve played thousands of games of Fifa against each other (starting from PES 06). We’ve shared many dozen a meal at his father’s restaurant. Somewhere along the line, he became my closest friend.</p>
